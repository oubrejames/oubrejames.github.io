        <title>Motion Mirroring Robotic Arm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;C, Mechatronics, Embedded Systems, I2C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Northwestern’s microprocessor design course, my group and I created an Electromyography
(EMG) controlled robotic manipulator. This allows a user to connect an EMG sensor to their arm to
open and close a robotic gripper by simply opening and closing their hand. We also combined project with 
another group in the class who were controlling a 2 DOF robotic arm’s motion based off of IMU data.
By combining these projects, we were able to create a system that would move a robot arm and control 
the gripper based off of the user’s motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emg-gripper&quot;&gt;EMG Gripper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y9bxQ33sTY&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was developed around the Microbit V2. Code is typically written to the Microbit in Python,
however, we were writing directly to the Microbit’s microcontroller (nRF52833) in C. The end-effector
itself is a mechanical gripper that opens and closes based off of the position of a connected servo.
We controlled this servo with a PCA9685 servo driver over I2C. Additionally, we used two sensors
in this project: an EMG sensor and a force sensitive resistor (FSR). The EMG sensor measures electrical 
signals in muscles that are generated from movement. This is attached to the users arm with electrodes
and used to detect if the hand is closed or not. The FSR measures the amount of
force that is applied to it. This is placed on the inside of the gripper and used to detect if the 
gripper is actively gripping something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic operation of this system is that the output of the two sensors are constantly being read
by the Microbit. If the EMG sensor gives a high signal, then the user is trying to grasp. When this
is detected, PWM signals are sent to the servo driver over I2C in a loop, closing the gripper incrementally
with each iteration. When an item is grasped, a forced is applied to the FSR, producing a 
high signal that is used to break the grasping loop and hold the gripper at a constant position.
Once, the user releases their grasp, the gripper will then start to incrementally open, unless
interrupted by another grasp command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oubrejames/emgripper&quot;&gt;View EMG Gripper Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emg-gripper--imu-arm&quot;&gt;EMG Gripper + IMU Arm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjytBSXibu4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the EMG gripper is combined with the IMU controlled arm, the resulting system allows a user to
manipulate the robot to perform various actions just by moving their own arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BotChocolate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer Vision, OpenCV, ROS2, Python, Motion Planning, Moveit, Intel Realsense, Emika Franka Robot Arm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_aNWWe4h5M&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project was to create hot chocolate using the Franka Emika 7 DOF robot arm. To perceive its environment, the system utilizes an Intel D435i camera AprilTags. Upon initial setup, a calibration process must be completed. After this, the process consisted of using AprilTags to locate a scoop of cocoa, a mug, a spoon, and a kettle relative to the robot. Next, using our custom MoveIt API for Python, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;movebot&lt;/code&gt;, the robot is able to perform path planning between all of these objects. It turns on the kettle, dumps the cocoa powder into the mug, pours the hot water over the power, and stirs the mixture it with the spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oubrejames/botchocolate&quot;&gt;View BotChocolate Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moveit-api&quot;&gt;Moveit API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the ROS2 MoveIt package does not have a Python API yet, creating one was the first step. By 
looking into the MoveIt ROS2 actions and services, we were able to create an API that takes either 
Cartesian coordinates of the Franka end-efffector or joint-state positions of each joint and creates
a path to the specified position. It also allows for the choice of moving in a Cartesian path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sed9XwHT-7c&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vision&quot;&gt;Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision system is comprised of two major parts: calibration and component location. AprilTags are
used to detect where each of the hot chocolate making components are. The AprilTags are located using
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apriltag_ros&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one tag fixed to a kettle and one tag fixed to a jig that has slots for a mug, cocoa scooper,
and a spoon. Once these tags are found in the camera frame, there are two transformation trees 
describing where all the hot chocolate components are relative to the camera and where each link of
the Franka robot arm is relative to the robot’s base. However, we need to connect these trees to 
get the location of each component relative to the robot’s base. This is where the calibration is 
used. An AprilTag must be placed in the robot’s gripper, aligned with the gripper’s
coordinate frame and in view of the camera to calibrate. We then wrote a program that finds the location of the tag
and relates it to the position of the base, connecting the robot frame to the camera frame. We then
save this transformation to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file to be used later on when running the main hot chocolate
making sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After obtaining the transformation from the camera to the robot, the robot can now use the locations
of the two AprilTags to locate and manipulate the hot chocolate components as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motion-planning&quot;&gt;Motion Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the locations of all the components are known, it’s time to make hot chocolate. Cartesian paths
are used to move the robot in straight lines and rotational path planning is used for achieving motions
like tilting to grab the scoop and dumping the cocoa. Both Cartesian and rotational motion are used to achieve pouring.
To make a cup of hot chocolate, the robot first turns on the kettle to heat the water, grab the cocoa scoop, 
pours it in a mug, pours the hot water over the powder, and stirs. We also used serval intermediate 
waypoints to help avoid reaching the joint limits of the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Physics Simulation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Python, Dynamic Systems, Simulation, Jupyter Notebook&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oubrejames/oubrejames.github.io/4b9a9bb1b282e894d9406c93f0adbf26e34a60b5/assets/images/cropped_jack.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jack_box_gif&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Lagrangian dynamics, I was able to simulate a box bouncing around within a larger box. First,
I calculated the potential and kinetic energies of the system to obtain its Lagrangian and later on,
the Euler-Lagrange equations. These equations describe the dynamics of the system while not
experiencing impact. To detect impact the following coordinate frames were used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46512429/208279053-1a1dd404-148d-4dbd-aadc-0b7c9d14c366.png&quot; alt=&quot;jack_box_gif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the transformation matrices between these frames, I am able to detect impact if any of the 
smaller box’s vertices intersect the larger box’s walls. Each vertex is checked against each wall 
for every time step of the simulation. If an impact is detected, the dynamic equations are updated and
the simulation continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DELETE BELOW++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the capstone for the Robotic Manipulation course, I created a software package to direct a Kuka YouBot to pick up and move a block in CoppeliaSim. This required first generating a trajectory for the end effector to reach the initial and final block locations, with intermediate stand-off and gripping poses, and then using inverse kinematics to determine the arm and chassis configurations. Additionally, I implemented a proportional integral controller to help correct for deviation from the planned trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/best.png&quot; alt=&quot;Best Controller Graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the best performance, I chose a proportional gain of 3 and an integral gain of 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;initial-overshoot-kp--3-ki--4&quot;&gt;Initial Overshoot: Kp = 3, Ki = 4&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simulate an initial overshoot, I chose a proportional gain of 3 and an integral gain of 4.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Orientation Hackathon: Pen Thief</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer Vision, OpenCV, Python, PincherX 100, Intel Realsense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JoxrQ2MmBp4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DELETE AND REDO THIS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final challenge of our hackathon orientation, we used Intel Realsense D435i cameras to locate a pen and direct a Trossen PincherX 100 robot to grab it. This was an individual challenge, and my first experience with computer vision algorithms. I leveraged the purple color of the pen to identify pixels within a color threshold, and the OpenCv and PyRealsense libraries to estimate the position of the pen in 3D space. Then, the algorithm incrementally increased or decreased the angle of the arm’s base joint until it was determined to be within range of the pen, and finally increased the elbow and shoulder joint angles to extend the end effector to reach the depth of the target pixels and close the grabbers. No pens were seriously harmed in this project (though one was dropped many times).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cocktail Maker</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ROS / MoveIt / Python / Computer Vision / Intel Realsense / Franka Emika Panda Arm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;424&quot; height=&quot;754&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqyQ7yTlyfM&quot; title=&quot;cocktail maker&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a team of 5 to program a Franka Emika Panda arm to make pancakes as our final project for ME 495: Embedded Systems in Robotics. As a team, we each took charge of a sub task and then worked together to integrate all the components into a fully autonomous product. I specifically was in charge of the batter dispensing task, and was heavily involved in developing strategies to increase the success rate of path planning in MoveIt. I utilized single joint control to include universal waypoints for each task and increase the success rate of path planning to tool locations found using computer vision. I additionally implemented action clients to control the gripper and grasp objects at a specified width with a given range of force, an element crucial to the reliability and safety of the batter pouring and flipping tasks. Lastly, I assisted with implementing the necessary transforms to translate coordinates found with our RealSense camera to coordinates in the robot’s frame. Object locations were determined using april tags, and the optimal time to begin the flipping process was determined with canny edge detection measuring the number and rate of change of the contours in the region of interest, much like a human pancake chef looking for bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my winter quarter independent study project, I set out to build my own version of a BallBot, a dynamically stable / statically unstable robot. I designed my bot from CAD to control algorithm, utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, and C programming on an RP2040 microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanical-design&quot;&gt;Mechanical Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/ballbot_CAD.png&quot; alt=&quot;CAD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed my chassis with inspiration from similar projects using Solidwork CAD to create 4 part adjustable base. Each motor housing component is attached to the main chassis separately, so the angle can be adjusted, which allowed me to test on various sizes of balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-the-structure-and-fundamental-electronics&quot;&gt;Building the Structure and Fundamental Electronics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/circuit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Circuit Diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After printing and assembling the chassis pieces, I mounted the 3 motors with 3 motor drivers and a RP2040 ThingPlus microcontroller and started with the basic control of one motor, working on a script to step one wheel at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/spinning.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Spinning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simultaneous-motor-control&quot;&gt;Simultaneous Motor Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to simultaneously step three motors. This proved to be a more difficult task than anticipated, as it seemed one motor would interfere with the other’s power source. However, after switching to drivers with a higher voltage rating, I was able to step each motor sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I could send alternating stepping commands to each motor, the base could perform basic directional movement including spinning in place and uniaxial paths (forwards, backwards, sideways).&lt;/p&gt;

Deriving wheel rotation rate from a twist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a truly omnidirectional base, the next step was to follow any twist, which require stepping the motors at different frequencies. I started with the most basic form of a control algorithm, a polling loop that stepped each motor after a calculated number of sleep cycles resulting in a wheel RPM calculated by the omnidirectional base matrix equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/omnidirectional.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile Base&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/control_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Control Diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the mobile base was capable of following any twist command, it was time to integrate the IMU sensor and create a closed control loop. In my first iteration, only the accelerometer data from the IMU was used to calculate a roll and pitch, which were then used as inputs to the PD controller. The PD controller outputs an x and y velocity relative to the robot’s base frame, which are then converted to wheel speeds and finally step delays using the omnidirectional base equation shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-righting&quot;&gt;Self-Righting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first milestone on the way to balancing was having the robot self-right itself back to a stable position on a ball. During testing, it became apparent that the motors would need to be stepped much faster in order for the robot to catch itself when the ball is not stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/self_righting.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Self Righting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-adjustments&quot;&gt;Design Adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I redesigned the initial concept and chose to try a much larger ball in order to reduce the angle of lean and therefor the lever arm of the robot’s body over its center of mass. This, along with reducing to half steps, resulted in a smoother self-righting action but the wheel stepping was still prohibitively slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/smoother.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A Little Smoother&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;control-adjustments-and-sensor-tuning&quot;&gt;Control Adjustments and Sensor Tuning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried several different approaches to the control algorithm once it became apparent that a simple polling loop would not step the motors at the required frequency. When I realized system clock-based interrupts were not support on the rp2040, I attempted 3 separate timers, with each frequency updated after every update from the IMU. While this was successful in spinning the wheels much faster, three timers could not keep up with the step frequency and the reliability of the original polling loop was lost. This was most likely due to the constant resetting of the timers and the competing operations with no set priorities. Finally, I was able to merge the control strategies and create a single timer at a fixed frequency that then counted the number of cycles since the previous step and compared the count to the calculated step delay. This significantly increased the speed of the wheels without compromising a quick and accurate twist response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/good_control.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Good Control&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timer came with a trade off between the IMU measurement frequency and the maximum step frequency, but I found reading the IMU at approximately 10 Hz (a 100 ms delay between measurements) and polling the motors at 500 Hz (a 2 ms timer) was most successful in generating a fast enough reaction time while supporting a high motor stepping frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the wheels more reactive, noise in the IMU also became more apparent. I started with a rolling average filter, which worked well to smooth the signal and reduce spikes. The rolling average was effective at slower speeds, but with a much more reactive control loop, I wanted to explore more advanced methods of sensor fusion. A complementary filter allowed me to supplement the noisy accelerometer data with the steadier (but driftier) gyroscope data. This significantly reduced the steady state measurement spikes from up to +/- 40 degree spikes to negligible noise when the bot is stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/complimentary_filter.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Getting Smoother&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/final.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Last Run&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after carefully tuning the PD gains and tweaking timer frequencies, my ballbot could balance for about 2 seconds before tipping over and losing control. I believe my biggest limitation was the tradeoff between measurement frequency and stepping frequency, and would like to try timer-based interrupts in future iteration or even separating the controller into multiple cores that could run the motor stepping commands and read the IMU simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my winter quarter independent study project, I set out to build my own version of a BallBot, a dynamically stable / statically unstable robot. I designed my bot from CAD to control algorithm, utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, and C programming on an RP2040 microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanical-design&quot;&gt;Mechanical Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/ballbot_CAD.png&quot; alt=&quot;CAD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed my chassis with inspiration from similar projects using Solidwork CAD to create 4 part adjustable base. Each motor housing component is attached to the main chassis separately, so the angle can be adjusted, which allowed me to test on various sizes of balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After printing and assembling the chassis pieces, I mounted the 3 motors with 3 motor drivers and a RP2040 ThingPlus microcontroller and started with the basic control of one motor, working on a script to step one wheel at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenCV / MediaPipe Pose Estimation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Project Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Detect yoga poses performed by a user and overlay a corresponding icon image. Running the main script starts the videostream with automatic pose detection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Part 1: Pose Detection &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I use the 32 body landmarks provided by MediaPipe to measure joint angles, then determine yoga poses based on key joint angles for each pose. For example, in the star pose, the angle between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist landmarks (elbow flexion) are below 20 degrees and the angle of the elbow, shoulder, and opposite shoulder (shoulder flexion) are also below 20 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Part 2: Icon Image Transformation &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To transform the icon image that will be overlayed over the user, I first preprocess the icon image then apply an affine transform. To preprocess the icon, I resize the icon image to be roughly the same heigt as the user, a metric also calculated with MediaPie&apos;s landmarks. I then apply a border to the icon image so that its image array has the same dimensions as the video stream frames. These steps help make the affine transform more effective. I select three key pose landmarks for each pose, then find three key points on the icon that should match these points. For example, I chose to match the nose and ankles of the person with the top tip and bottom two tips of the star. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Part 3: Image Overlay &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I overlayed just the icon pixels (the icon background is ignored) by summing .5 of the icon pixel value with .5 of the the video frame value, resulting in a transparent overlay of just the icon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Results &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Star Pose&lt;/h3&gt;
