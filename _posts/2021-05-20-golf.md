## Overview

The purpose of this project is to imitate a golf range finder using a normal, non-depth, camera. The
program was written using Python and OpenCV and the algorithm pipeline is shown below.

First, the user takes an image of the flag and draws a rectangle around the flag. This region is 
cropped out and the color of the flag is then detected. After the color of the flag is found, the 
flag is cropped out using contour detection and the pixel length of the side of the flag is measured.
 Using this pixel length, the distance to the flag could be calculated using triangle similarity and
displayed on the userâ€™s screen.

## Results

Overall, the range finder worked well. It was very precise and accurate for smaller distances. 
However, as the distances began to increase, the program was less successful. Test results can be 
seen below. One reason this could be happening is that the farther away the flag is, the smaller it 
is on the picture. This makes it much more difficult get an accurate pixel count to calculate the 
distance to the flag. Using a higher resolution image could help mitigate this problem.
