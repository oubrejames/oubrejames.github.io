## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create hot chocolate using the Franka Emika 7 DOF robot arm. To perceive the environment, the system utilizes an Intel D435i camera AprilTags. Upon initial setup, a calibration process must be completed. After this, the process consisted of using AprilTags to locate a scoop of cocoa, a mug, a spoon, and a kettle relative to the robot. Next, using our custom MoveIt API for Python, movebot, the robot is able to perform path planning between all of these objects. It turns on the kettle, dumps the cocoa powder into the mug, pours the hot water over the power, and stirs the mixture it with the spoon.

## Moveit API
Because the ROS2 MoveIt package does not have a Python API yet, the first step in this project was to
create one. By looking into the MoveIt ROS2 actions and services, we were able to create an API that
takes either Cartesian coordinates of the Franka end-efffector or joint-state positions of each joint
 and creates a path to the specified position. It also allows for the choice of moving in a Cartesian path.
