## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a system that could identify individual ants in a colony. Using
a machine vision camera equipped with a macro lens, I was able to collect ___insert number here___ images
of ___insert number here___ different harvester ants. These images were then used to train a machine learning
network to create a feature vector, or embedding, to describe each ant. By comparing embeddings of two
ants, a threshold could be used to determine if the ants are the same or different with a ___ give accuracy,
recall, precision, or whatever. 

## Why Ants?
The first reaction when I tell people about this project is typically something along the lines of "how
is this useful?" or "why would you want to do that?". The answer is that for most people, it's not
useful at all. However, for myrmecologists (ant scientists), it is very useful. Ants are very social 
insects that are commonly used to study social behavior and can be used to learn more about how swarms
of robots can be used to accomplish tasks. The current way of tracking individual ants in a colony is
an extremely tedious process that involves manually labeling each ant in a colony by painting different
patterns on them. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/uAQ5IKVpysc">this video</a> to see exactly how tedious
this process can be. By creating a system that can automatically identify individual ants, we can save researchers a lot of time and effort.

<p align = "center">Ant World</p>

* Image from github showing all the different components
* Give overview of the living spaces
* Describe camera and lens and why I chose them (all the specs and shit)
* Talk about light box

## Data Collection
* Explaining the C++ library and why I made it/what it does (data collect script)
* Give explanation of data collection process
* Have more pictures to supplement words like picture of pass thru under camera

## Methodology
* talk about entire pipeline (might need to add voting and single pass detection)
* have a diagram of the pipeline
* very briefly overview the yolo steps
* go into detail about the embedding steps and triplet loss (mention/link facenet)
* have model architecture here 
* talk about how I chose threshold
* if you do voting explain how that increased the accuracy

## Results
* Give confusion matrix
* explain how I defined accuracy
* if you do voting say differences in accuracy and stuff between that and non-voting
* explain how I used thresholding and show graph with different thresholds
