## Overview
For my senior capstone project, I was a part of a group that converted an internal combustion FSAE
racecar to be fully electric. The electrical side of the project consisted of creating a custom high
voltage battery pack with a battery management system to power the vehicle's motor. There was also 
a low voltage subsystem composed of a device to check for braking and accelerating faults, a circuit
to cut off high voltage power in case of errors, and 12 V bus for miscellaneous electronics. Furthermore,
because we were converting an existing internal combustion vehicle, certain mechanical alterations
were made. Personally, I was responsible for the low voltage subsystem and acted as team treasurer. 

## Low Voltage Electrical
The low voltage system is broken up into three main parts: the acceleration and 
brake fault detection device, the safety shutdown circuit, and the 12 V bus. Each of these subsystems
is descriebd in more detail later on. The purpose of this subsystem is to handle all auxillory functions
of the vehicle. Bassically any function of the car outside of the high voltage power train is a part
of the low voltage system. Below is the circuit diagram for the vehicles auxillory systems.

### Acceleration and Brake Fault Detection Device
One key feature of this project is the acceleration and brake fault detection device. This device 
detects the following accelerating and braking conditions that could cause harm to the driver:
* Simultaneous pressing of accelerator and brake pedals
* Significant current delivered to motor while driver is hard braking 
* Short or open circuits in the accelerator and break pedal sensors

If any of these faults were detetected, a trigger signal is sent to a 500 ms timer which would then 
actuate a relay to open the saftey shutdown circuit and cut off high voltage power. The logic is 
described in the diagram below.

Per FSAE rules, the device had to be compeltely analog. Because of this, I chose to detect faults 
using op-amp comparators and logic gates. If the input signal from the sensor went above a certain 
value or outside a specified range, the comparator would send a high signal to 500 ms timer. Below is
the circuit diagram for the device.

Using EaglePCB, I created the manufacturing drawings for the board's PCB. I then ordered the board 
and solderred the components on myself.

### Safety Shutdown Circuit

A safety shutdown circuit was created to cut off high powered electricity in unsafe conditions. This
circuit connects the 12 V batterry to the coils of the two high power relays that are connected to 
the vehicle's high power battery or accumulator. The rest of the circuit is a number of switches and
relays in series such that if any are disconnected, the circuit is open and no voltage is applied to 
the accumulator relay coils. When there is no voltage at these coils, they are open and the accumulator
is disconnected. 

The circuit has 3 emergency stop buttons, 2 master switches, a brake over travel 
switch, and 2 low voltage relays. The brake over travel switch is a toggle switch located behind the 
break pedal such that if the brakes are pressed extremly hard, the flip is switched and the circuit 
is opened. The 2 low votlage relays are connected to the acceleration and brake fault detection device 
(shown as APPS/BSPD) and the insulation monitoring device (IMD). The IMD measures the insulation 
between the high voltage bus and the chassis ground. If a short between the two is detected, the 
device outputs a high signal to open the relay in the shutdown circuit.

### Low Voltage Power
Part of this project was ensuring it could withstand the FSAE endurance event which we calculated would
take about 30 minutes. To spec out the battery for this, I found the max current draw of each component
on the 12 V bus to be 34.6 A. To complete the endurance event the vehicle required a battery with a
capacity of 17.3 Ah.
