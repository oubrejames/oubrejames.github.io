## Overview
As the capstone project for Northwesternâ€™s Robotic Manipulation course I simulated a KUKA youBot
moving to a cube, grasping it, and then placing it in a desired position. First, I created a function
to generate trajectories from the robot's starting position to all the different waypoints to 
complete the task. The homogeneous transformation matrices between waypoints are used to create a 
screw or Cartesian trajectories between points. These trajectories are then stored in a matrix representing 
the desired movement of the robot's chassis and end effector. Next, I implemented a PID feedback
controller based off of the robot's current position and odometry to ensure that the robot can self
correct if error is introduced. Lastly, the actual positions of the robot are stored in a CSV file
and used to simulate the robot in Coppeliasim.

## Results
The simulation completed the task in three different scenarios: with poor PID gains, tuned
PID gains, and a different start and end configuration for the cube.  Overall, each 
simulation is able to reduce to zero error before the robot gets the the cube's standoff position.
