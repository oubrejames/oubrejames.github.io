## Overview 
As the final project for my Sensors and Actuators class at LSU, I designed an automated cocktail maker.
Using three ultrasonic distance sensors offset at different heights, the system can detect three different 
heights of cups corresponding to a wine glass, pint glass, and a cocktail glass. I implemented logic
on an Arduino to decide what kind of glass is present based off the sensor outputs. Once the type of
cup is known, the Arduino turns on pumps connected to the corresponding cocktail ingredients. Originally,
the system was supposed to dispense wine for the wine glass, beer for the pint, and a mixed drink for
the cocktail glass. However, beer did not dispense properly from the pump and it mostly dispensed
foam so I changed it to dispense a different mixed drink. I also did not actually have any wine when 
making the video so I used water. 
The logic used is shown in the pipeline below.

## Electrical Design
The electrical design is shown in the image below. The system is powered from a wall outlet to a 12
V power supply. A 7 V voltage regulator is used to power the Arduino and the 12 volts powers a relay
 module which, in turn, powers the pumps. To actually dispense the liquid, the Arduino sends a high
 signal to the corresponding pin on the relay module to close the relay and turn on the pump.
