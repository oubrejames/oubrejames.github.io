## Overview
While at LSU, I completed a minor in robotics engineering alongside my electrical engineering
major. For this minor I took a number of robotics related classes covering a range of topics. Many 
of these classes were very hands on and I got a lot of useful project experience. Two of the 
courses that I found particularly useful were Intro to Robotics Engineering and Autonomous Robotic Vehicles

In Intro to Robotics Engineering we learned about a broad array of topics from mechanical design to 
software. We learned about robotic actuators and mobility mechanisms, robot motion control, navigation 
and mapping, and human-robot interaction. Particularly, we had many interesting projects involving 
the Parallax Activitybots, hexapods, and Turtlebots. Furthermore, the class focused heavily on learning
ROS and had many labs, classes, and assignments dedicated to learning it. 

Autonomous Robotic Vehicles covered topics like vehicle kinematics, motion control, perception, 
localization, path planning, and navigation. In the class we learned about and implemented different 
probabilistic methods like Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for navigation. As our final 
project of the class, we implemented an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM using Python and ROS on a Turtlebot 
to navigate through a maze, map it, and localize itself.

## Projects
* <ins>**Maze solving robot (leftmost gif)**</ins>:  Programmed Parallax Activitybot in C++ to navigate through a 
maze, create a map of the maze, and save the quickest path to the end

* <ins>**Hexapod (middle gif)**</ins>:  Explored different gaits and control to move the hexapod in 
particular ways, achieve turning motions, and climb stairs

* <ins>**Increasing Activitybot Payload (rightmost gif)**</ins>:  Created an external chassis for the
Activitybot and retrofitted its drivetrain with different gears to increase its torque capacity to 
push heavier objects

* <ins>**Extended Kalman Filter SLAM on Turtlebot**</ins>:  Implemented EKF SLAM using Python and ROS 
to navigate through a maze, map it, and localize itself.
