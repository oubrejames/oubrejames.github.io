In my undergraduate microcontrollers course I set out to dynamically measure knee flexion inspired by my experience interning in sports medicine. Using the Arduino IDE and simple hardware including a potentiometer, piezo buzzer, and RBG LED, I constructed a wearable device that continuously tracked the angle of the wearer's knee and provided audio and visual feedback when they were in the target flexion range. With the Java language in Processing, I created a GUI for the user to control a character dodging bananas and view metrics displayed in real time.
